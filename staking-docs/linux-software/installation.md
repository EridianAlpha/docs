{% endcontent-ref %}

### üîß System Configuration

Add useful `Bash` aliases.

{% code fullWidth="true" %}
```bash
echo "alias lsl='ls -la'" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "alias clc='clear'" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "alias myip='echo Response from https://ipinfo.io/ip:; curl https://ipinfo.io/ip; echo'" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "alias ports='sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN'" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "alias update-system='sudo apt-get update -y; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y'" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "alias update-firmware='fwupdmgr refresh; fwupdmgr get-updates; fwupdmgr update'" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "alias update-kernel='sudo apt-get install -y linux-image-generic-hwe-22.04'" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "alias daemon-reload='sudo systemctl daemon-reload'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
{% endcode %}

Update kernel to the latest version for 22.04.

```bash
update-kernel
```

Update system packages.

```bash
update-system
```

Install useful packages.

```sh
sudo apt-get install -y \
git \
build-essential \
software-properties-common \
pkg-config \
cmake \
clang \
wget \
curl \
ccze \
vim \
mlocate \
jq \
net-tools \
unzip \
screen \
mosh \
ufw \
fwupd \
linux-tools-common \
linux-tools-generic
```

```bash
sudo snap install btop
```

Update the system again after installing all packages.

```bash
update-system
```

Update [firmware](https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd).

```bash
update-firmware
```

Restart machine.

```bash
sudo shutdown -r now
```

Set up `btop`.

```bash
btop
```

* Press `ESC` key to see menu and select `OPTIONS`.
* Change theme to TTY.
* Change time interval to 1000ms.

### üö™ Change Default SSH Port

Useful when you have multiple machines running on the same ip address.

```bash
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Uncomment `#Port 22` and change it to your modified ssh port.

Restart the `sshd` service.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

### üöß Firewall Configuration

Confirm UFW is disabled before blocking everything or you could be disconnected.

```bash
sudo ufw disable
sudo ufw status
```

Configure the firewall.

```bash
CUSTOM_SSH_PORT=                  # Default: 22
MOSH_STARTING_PORT=               # Default: 60000
MOSH_ENDING_PORT=                 # Default: 61000

sudo ufw default deny incoming comment 'Deny all incoming traffic'
sudo ufw default allow outgoing comment 'Allow all outgoing traffic'

sudo ufw allow ${CUSTOM_SSH_PORT} comment 'Allow custom ssh in'
sudo ufw allow ${MOSH_STARTING_PORT}:${MOSH_ENDING_PORT}/udp comment 'Allow Mosh in'
```

Edit the UFW settings to disable IPV6. This isn't for any particular security reason, it just makes the UFW status easier to read when it prints out on screen.

```bash
sudo vim /etc/default/ufw
```

Change `IPV6` to `no`.

```bash
IPV6=no
```

Enable UFW.

```bash
# <USE --FORCE TO STOP THE PROMPT ASKING IF YOU WANT TO ENABLE>
sudo ufw --force enable

sudo ufw status verbose
```

### üìÖ noatime

By default, Linux will write a new file timestamp on every read. As you may imagine, this is no bueno for database applications like an Ethereum node.

You can increase the lifetime of your SSD - and incidentally get a small speed boost - by turning this "atime" feature off. [\[1\]](https://eth-docker.net/Usage/LinuxSecurity#noatime)

```bash
sudo vim /etc/fstab
```

Find the entry for your `/` filesystem.

{% code title="/etc/fstab" fullWidth="false" %}
```bash
# BEFORE
# /dev/disk/by-id/dm-uuid-LVM-u1...i3uPy21O / ext4 defaults 0 1

# AFTER
/dev/disk/by-id/dm-uuid-LVM-u1...i3uPy21 / ext4 defaults,noatime 0 1
```
{% endcode %}

Don't delete any parameters, just add `,noatime`. And make sure to add that to the 4th column, not anywhere else.

Save the file, and if the following command then runs without any errors, the configuration is correct.

```
sudo mount -o remount /
```

### üîÅ Turn off swap

If you have a lot of RAM you can turn off swap completely. [\[2\]](https://eth-docker.net/Usage/LinuxSecurity#swappiness)

```
sudo swapoff -a
```

```bash
sudo vim /etc/fstab
```

Find the entry for your `/` filesystem.

{% code title="/etc/fstab" fullWidth="false" %}
```bash
# BEFORE
/swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0

# AFTER
#/swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0
```
{% endcode %}

### üéöÔ∏è cpupower

Some CPUs have a power saving feature that reduces their speed when not in use. This doesn't work well for Ethereum nodes as the time between blocks can cause CPUs to slow down... only to need them to speed back up again when a block arrives.

```bash
cpupower

# <INSTALL THE VERSION IT THEN SUGGESTS>
sudo apt-get install -y <SUGGESTED_VERSION>

cpupower frequency-info

# <CHECK THAT THIS ROW EXISTS>
# available cpufreq governors: performance powersave
```

If the performance option exists, set that.

```bash
sudo cpupower frequency-set -g performance
```

Then create a service to set `performance` after reboot as that setting doesn't persist on its own.

```bash
sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/cpupower.service
```

{% code title="/etc/systemd/system/cpupower.service" %}
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Set CPU governor to performance

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/cpupower frequency-set -g performance

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
{% endcode %}

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable cpupower.service
sudo systemctl status cpupower.service
```

### üìè Use all Available Disk Space

```bash
sudo lvdisplay # Check your logical volume size

sudo lvm # Attach the lvm console
lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv
lvextend -l +100%FREE -r /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv
exit

sudo resize2fs /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv
df -h # Check results
```

### ü´£ Hide Welcome Message on Login

Some of the messages are useful so I don't want to hide everything, but some are annoying.

Hide parts of the message by making the template `non-executable`.

```bash
sudo chmod -x /etc/update-motd.d/10-help-text
sudo chmod -x /etc/update-motd.d/50-motd-news
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è Increases Service Shutdown Timer

I was concerned that the default time of 180 seconds wouldn't be long enough for all the services running to gracefully shutdown.

The shutdown time can be individually set on each service, but this is a catch-all.

```bash
sudo vim /etc/systemd/system.conf
```

Uncomment out the line `#DefaultTimeoutStopSec=90s` and change it to `1200s`.

### üõë Brute-Force SSH Protection

To protect your server from brute-force SSH connection attempts, you can install `fail2ban` which will monitor incoming connections and block IP addresses that try to log in with faulty credentials repeatedly.

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y fail2ban
sudo vim /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/ssh.local
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you're using a non-standard SSH port that isn't `22` then you will need to change that in the cofig file below.
{% endhint %}

{% code title="/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/ssh.local" %}
```bash
[sshd]
enabled = true
banaction = ufw
port = <SSH_PORT>
filter = sshd
logpath = %(sshd_log)s
maxretry = 5
```
{% endcode %}

You can change the `maxretry` setting, which is the number of attempts it will allow before locking the offending address out.

Save the file and restart the service.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
```

### üì± SSH Security - 2FA

{% endcontent-ref %}

### üê≥ Install Docker

{% code fullWidth="true" %}
```bash
# Update the package index
sudo apt-get update -y

# Install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS
sudo apt-get install -y \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release
    
# Add Docker's official GPG key
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

# Set up the stable repository
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

# Update the package index again
sudo apt-get update -y

# Install the latest version of Docker Engine and containerd
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

# To use Docker without sudo, add your current user to the docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
{% endcode %}

Log out and log back in or restart your machine for the group membership to take effect. You should now be able to run Docker commands without `sudo`.

### üö¶ Git Configuration

Edit the Git configuration.

```bash
vim ~/.gitconfig
```

Add this to the `[alias]` section for a pretty view of commit tree for current branch.

```
[alias] tree = log --color --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(bold magenta)%d%Creset %s %C(cyan)(%cr)%C(bold blue) <%an> %Creset' --date=relative --abbrev-commit --all
[alias] tree-current = log --color --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(bold magenta)%d%Creset %s %C(cyan)(%cr)%C(bold blue) <%an> %Creset' --date=relative --abbrev-commit --all
```

Then run these commands in a directory using Git to see a pretty view of the commit tree.

```bash
git tree
git tree-current
```

### üìù Systemd Journal Logs

The systemd services create logs that grow over time. It is possible to clear the logs to free up disk space on your server. The following steps will delete existing log data.

Be careful if you require this data for debugging purposes.

Check the amount of disk space the logs are using.

```bash
sudo journalctl --disk-usage
```

To clear the logs use the following command.

* The `--flush` flag flushes the logs currently in memory onto the disk.
* The `--rotate` flag archives the existing logs so they can‚Äôt be written to anymore and starts new logs for each service.
* The `--vacuum-time` flag deletes log data that is older than `28 days`.

```bash
sudo journalctl --flush --rotate
sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=28days
```

It is recommended to check the logs are in a good state after the vacuum operation.

Each log should have a status of `PASS`.

```bash
sudo journalctl --verify
```

To have the system automatically keep log data to a specified max size complete the following additional steps.

Open the systemd journal service configuration file.

```bash
sudo vim /etc/systemd/journald.conf
```

Edit the file to set the maximum disk space that can be used by the journal in persistent storage.

Remove the `#` from the line `SystemMaxUse` and add a value in megabytes, say `10000M`.

Restart the `journald` after updating the file.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald
```

Journal logs will now be limited to 1000MB in size.
