## Why 0x?

&#x20;In Ethereum, and more broadly in the world of cryptography and blockchain technology, the prefix "0x" is used to denote that the following string is in hexadecimal (base 16) format. Hexadecimal is a numeral system that uses 16 symbols: 0-9 to represent values 0 to 9 and A-F to represent values 10 to 15.

{% code title="Hexadecimal " %}
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F
```
{% endcode %}

By starting with `0x` Ethereum ensures that there is no ambiguity about the format of the data, which is crucial for the proper functioning of smart contracts and transactions.

`0x` "The string that follows is a hexadecimal!"
{% endhint %}

For example, an Ethereum address looks like `0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266` and is represented in a hexadecimal format.

You'll notice from the table that the hexadecimal representation is the shortest number of characters. Each hexadecimal digit represents four binary digits (bits). This means a long binary string can be represented by a much shorter hexadecimal string, making it easier to read, write, and communicate.

## uint8 - Smallest Example

A `uint8` in Solidity is an unsigned integer that can hold values from 0 to 255.&#x20;

It uses 8 bits (1 byte) to represent these values.

An 8-bit binary number can range from `00000000` (0) to `11111111` (255). For example, the number 150 in binary is `10010110`.

Group the 8 bits into two 4-bit groups (nibbles): `1001` and `0110`.

**Convert to Hexadecimal**:

* `1001` in binary is `9` in hexadecimal.
* `0110` in binary is `6` in hexadecimal.

Thus, the binary `10010110` becomes `0x96` in hexadecimal.

In Solidity, these are equivalent statements:

```solidity
uint8 public myNumberDecimal = 150;
uint8 public myNumberHex = 0x96;
```

## uint256 - Biggest Example

A `uint256` variable can hold values from `0` to `2^256 - 1`.

**Bits and Bytes**:

* `uint256` means it is an unsigned integer that uses 256 bits.
* 256 bits = 32 bytes (since 1 byte = 8 bits).
