### 2.1 What is the difference between transfer and send?

* `send`
  * Returns a bool indicating success (true) or failure (false).
  * Only forwards a fixed 2300 gas stipend, which is often enough for basic operations but might not suffice for complex logic in the receiving contract.
  * If the transfer fails, it does not revert the transaction. You need to handle the failure by checking the return value.
* `transfer`
  * Automatically reverts the transaction if the transfer fails, so no additional error handling is needed.
  * Also forwards a fixed 2300 gas stipend, preventing the receiving contract from executing too much code.
  * Generally considered safer because it reverts on failure, meaning you donâ€™t have to manually check for success.

### 2.2 Why should they not be used?

Due to the fixed gas limits, they are not flexible enough to work with smart contract wallets which may require more gas than is available from `transfer` or `send`.

### 2.3 What is a storage collision in a proxy contract?

When a function in the proxy contract has the same 4-byte identifier as a function in the implementation contract. This will cause a collision and mean that the function in the implementation contract can never be called.

### 2.4 What is the difference between abi.encode and abi.encodePacked?

* `abi.encode`
  * Encodes data in ABI (Application Binary Interface) encoding format.
  * Adds padding to make each data item fit into a 32-byte slot, following the ABI encoding standards.
  * Each argument is encoded as a standalone item, with proper padding and alignment, which makes it more readable and less error-prone when used in conjunction with other Solidity functions.
  * Example:&#x20;
    * Input: `bytes memory encodedData = abi.encode("Hello", uint256(123));`
    * Output (encodedData): `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000040000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007b000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000548656c6c6f000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` (padded to 32 bytes).
* `abi.encodePacked`
  * Encodes data in a compact, non-standard format.
  * Does not add padding, so each data item is placed directly after the previous one without any alignment.
  * Generally used for more compact encoding or for concatenating data, such as when creating a unique hash (e.g., in keccak256 hashing).
  * **Be careful with potential collisions**:
    * Concatenating variable-length types (like string and bytes) without padding can result in ambiguous results. For example, encoding two strings with abi.encodePacked("abc", "def") and abi.encodePacked("ab", "cdef") would produce the same output.
  * Example:
    * Input: `bytes memory packedData = abi.encodePacked("Hello", uint256(123));`
    * Output (packedData): `0x48656c6c6f000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007b000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` (no padding).
